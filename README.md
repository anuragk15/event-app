# Event App

# AI Agent Prompt

## Project Overview

EventFlow is a white-label SaaS platform for creating branded event registration pages. The system enables non-technical users to design, deploy, and manage professional registration experiences without coding. The platform bridges the gap between DIY form builders and enterprise event management platforms, offering template-driven customization, real-time analytics, and native integrations with webinar platforms (Zoom, Hopin, StreamYard) and marketing automation tools (HubSpot, Marketo, Mailchimp).

**Target Users:** Marketing managers, event coordinators, product managers, and business development professionals at companies hosting 2-50 events annually.

**Success Metrics:** Registration page creation time <5 minutes, conversion rate improvement of 15-25% vs. generic forms, 90%+ customer retention, NPS >50.
